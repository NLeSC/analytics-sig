# analytics-sig: Analytics Special Interest Group

The mission of this SIG is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center, as well as their technical implementations. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.

We meet roughly every 4 weeks and have, in between, also shared sessions with with Machine Learning SIG.
